# node-uuid

Simple, fast generation of [RFC4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) UUIDS.

Features:

* Generate RFC4122 version 1 or version 4 UUIDs
* Runs in node.js and all browsers.
* Registered as a [ComponentJS](https://github.com/component/component) [component](https://github.com/component/component/wiki/Components) ('broofa/node-uuid').
* Cryptographically strong random # generation on supporting platforms
* 1.1K minified and gzip'ed  (Want something smaller?  Check this [crazy shit](https://gist.github.com/982883) out! )
* [Annotated source code](http://broofa.github.com/node-uuid/docs/uuid.html)
* Comes with a Command Line Interface for generating uuids on the command line

## Getting Started

Install it in your browser:

```html
<script src="uuid.js"></script>
```

Or in node.js:

```
npm install node-uuid
```

```javascript
var uuid = require('node-uuid');
```

Then create some ids ...

```javascript
// Generate a v1 (time-based) id
uuid.v1(); // -> '6c84fb90-12c4-11e1-840d-7b25c5ee775a'

// Generate a v4 (random) id
uuid.v4(); // -> '110ec58a-a0f2-4ac4-8393-c866d813b8d1'
```

## API

### uuid.v1([`options` [, `buffer` [, `offset`]]])

Generate and return a RFC4122 v1 (timestamp-based) UUID.

* `options` - (Object) Optional uuid state to apply. Properties may include:

  * `node` - (Array) Node id as Array of 6 bytes (per 4.1.6). Default: Randomly generated ID.  See note 1.
  * `clockseq` - (Number between 0 - 0x3fff) RFC clock sequence.  Default: An internally maintained clockseq is used.
  * `msecs` - (Number | Date) Time in milliseconds since unix Epoch.  Default: The current time is used.
  * `nsecs` - (Number between 0-9999) additional time, in 100-nanosecond units. Ignored if `msecs` is unspecified. Default: internal uuid counter is used, as per 4.2.1.2.

* `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written.
* `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing.

Returns `buffer`, if specified, otherwise the string form of the UUID
