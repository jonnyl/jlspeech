# combined-stream [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/felixge/node-combined-stream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/felixge/node-combined-stream)

A stream that emits multiple other streams one after another.

## Installation

``` bash
npm install combined-stream
```

## Usage

Here is a simple example that shows how you can use combined-stream to combine
two files into one:

``` javascript
var CombinedStream = require('combined-stream');
var fs = require('fs');

var combinedStream = CombinedStream.create();
combinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream('file1.txt'));
combinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream('file2.txt'));

combinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('combined.txt'));
```

While the example above works great, it will pause all source streams until
they are needed. If you don't want that to happen, you can set `pauseStreams`
to `false`:

``` javascript
var CombinedStream = require('combined-stream');
var fs = require('fs');

var combinedStream = CombinedStream.create({pauseStreams: false
