            <div class="active item">Jackie is absolutely amazing to work with. When our son Amos started with her, he had no expressive language and struggled to communicate verbally. Jackie was extremely patient, upbeat, warm and attentive and I can't begin to tell you how thrilled we've been with Amos' progress. In a short time, he's fully communicating in long sentences, is extremely focused, and most of all, is so proud of himself. We attribute his great success to his work with Jackie and recommend her wholeheartedly. Amos loved his sessions with her and she created a wonderful rapport with Amos, and us. You will be so lucky and happy to work with Jackie, and your child will benefit greatly.</div>
            <div class="item">Jackie worked with my then 5 year old for almost a year. From the start, she was a perfect match, as her professional and personal qualities supported my daughter's struggles with confidence, anxiety and expressive language. Jackie has tremendous patience and warmth that immediately puts people, and particularly children at ease, while commanding authority and control over her workshops. The sessions were a great balance of play and work that appeared casual and fun but were indeed structured and purposed. What I valued most about Jackie was her strong empathy and communication with me as a parent. Jackie constantly explained her process and shared classroom tools and games, which enabled a continuation of the therapy into our home and provided much-needed consistency for our daughter.</div>
            <div class="item">Jackie has a winsome sparkle that children can and do respond to immediately.  She gained my son’s trust and affection seemingly effortlessly.  Her calm, engaging way of communicating puts parent and child at ease, and her office creates a safe environment for her work with the children. 
             
            <p>Jackie takes in to consideration the whole picture.  She factors in home life, school life, and a child’s unique quirks and particular challenges.  She keeps fluid dialogue with parents and charts the child’s development in a comprehensive way.  Her positivity and passion for her work infuses every conversation.  I am grateful for all the strides my child made during his time working with Jackie, and I credit her with helping him learn how to express himself and engage with others more effectively.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">Thank you Jackie for being an energetic, caring, collaborative and committed speech therapist for my three year old daughter. We started with Jackie in doing sessions twice a week privately after my daughter was diagnosed as having a phonological delay. Jackie was extremely thoughtful about ways she engaged my daughter (who can be very willful and stubborn) during our sessions as well as sending me homework/tips for my follow up with her at home. Jackie was also very helpful when we started to navigate the special education process for preschoolers and presented us with a letter of support with ease and at no inconvenience. With her help, we were pleased to have the school district grant us speech as part of my daughter's special needs services. 

            <p>Truly, my daughter improved tremendously as a patient of Jackie's for nearly a year. Since she is moving from practicing in NYC to practicing in NJ, we have no choice but to sadly discontinue working with Jackie. We miss her terribly but know and hope she continues to touch the lives of many children as wonderfully as she touched ours.</p>
