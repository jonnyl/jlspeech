					<p class="lead">A speech language
					pathologist can assist you in finding the answers you seek, while guiding
					you on a path to understanding. A common misconception of a speech
					language pathologist is that their forte is to correct mispronounced
					speech sounds but in fact, that is just a fraction of their skill set.</p>

					<p class="lead">For the past decade, I have devoted myself to providing the highest
					quality of speech and language services to children with communication
					disorders via ongoing assessment, family involvement and ever-evolving
					treatment programs, carefully catered to address my clients’ unique
					needs and learning styles. As a speech language pathologist, I have
					worked extensively with youngsters who present with various language
					and articulation disorders, auditory processing disorders, receptive
					and expressive language delays, writing disorders, and executive
					function deficits. Collaboration with family members, teachers and
					other interdisciplinary team members has aided me in fostering a safe,
					supportive learning environment for each of my clients.</p>

					<p class="lead">Whether your child would benefit from a naturalistic, play-based
					approach, or needs a more structured environment, you can rest assured
					that I will create a nurturing, motivating and enriching program to
					address your child’s individual needs.</p>

					<p class="lead">I have worked in educational, clinical, and home-based settings with
					children ranging in age from preschool through high school. Evaluations
					and therapy programs are available in home or office upon request.</p>

					<p class="lead">Diagnostic and therapy services are available both individually and
					[when appropriate] in small groups to children and adolescents with a
					range of communication and learning difficulties.</p>
